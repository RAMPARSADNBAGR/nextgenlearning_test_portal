    "options": [
      "Organ → Tissue → Cell → Organ system → Organism",
      "Cell → Tissue → Organ → Organ system → Organism",
      "Cell → Organ → Tissue → Organism → Organ system",
      "Tissue → Cell → Organ system → Organ → Organism"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cells of similar structure and function group to form tissues, tissues combine to form organs, organs form organ systems, and organ systems together form an organism. The other sequences place these levels out of order and do not reflect how the body is actually built up.",

    "question": "Which statement best defines a tissue?",
    "options": [
      "Any collection of cells found in one part of the body",
      "A group of cells, similar in structure, that work together to perform a specific function",
      "A single cell capable of performing all life functions",
      "An organ made of two or more cell types"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A tissue is a group of structurally similar cells working together for a specific function, which brings about division of labour in the body. Option A is too vague since not all nearby cells form a functional tissue, option C describes a unicellular organism like amoeba, and option D actually describes an organ, not a tissue.",

      "Connective tissue",
      "Muscular tissue",
      "Nervous tissue"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Muscular tissue is made of cells specialised to contract and relax, producing movement. Epithelial tissue covers and protects, connective tissue links and supports structures, and nervous tissue only transmits signals rather than generating movement itself.",

      "Phloem",
      "Xylem",
      "Parenchyma",
      "Epidermis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Xylem is the conducting tissue that carries water and minerals upward from the roots and also gives mechanical strength to the plant. Phloem instead transports food, parenchyma mainly stores materials, and the epidermis is a protective outer layer, not a conducting tissue.",

      "Phloem",
      "Collenchyma"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Phloem, through its sieve tubes, moves prepared food from the leaves to other parts of the plant, including storage organs and roots. Xylem transports water, while sclerenchyma and collenchyma are supporting tissues, not conducting tissues.",

      "Permanent tissue",
      "Meristematic tissue",
      "Vascular tissue",
      "Ground tissue"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Meristematic tissue consists of actively and continuously dividing cells that are responsible for growth in plants. Permanent tissue, in contrast, is made of differentiated cells that have generally lost the ability to divide, while vascular and ground tissue are broader functional groupings rather than descriptions of dividing ability.",

    "options": [
      "Transporting food to the roots",
      "Providing protection against injury, water loss and microbes",
      "Increasing the girth of the stem",
      "Storing large amounts of food"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The epidermis forms the outermost protective layer of the plant body, often covered with a waxy cuticle, shielding the plant from mechanical injury, excess water loss and microbial invasion. Food transport is carried out by phloem, girth increase is due to the lateral meristem, and food storage is mainly a parenchyma function.",

      "Connective tissue",
      "Nervous tissue"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Both blood and bone are connective tissues that connect and support other tissues, differing mainly in the nature of their matrix, which is fluid in blood and rigid in bone. Epithelial tissue would instead form coverings and linings, muscular tissue would generate movement, and nervous tissue would transmit impulses.",

      "Axon terminals"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Dendrites are the branch-like extensions of a neuron that receive incoming signals from other neurons. The axon carries messages away from the cell body toward the axon terminals, which then pass the message on to other cells, while the cell body houses the nucleus and controls overall cell activity.",

    "question": "In an onion-root experiment, roots in Jar A were left untouched while roots in Jar B had their tips cut off. What result would you expect, and why?",
    "options": [
      "Both jars show identical growth, since meristem is spread evenly along the whole root",
      "Roots in Jar A keep growing while roots in Jar B stop growing, because the dividing cells are concentrated at the root tip",
      "Roots in Jar B grow faster than Jar A, because cutting stimulates extra cell division everywhere",
      "Neither root grows further, because cutting damages the whole plant's meristem"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Since the apical meristem responsible for growth in length is located specifically at the root tip, removing the tip removes the actively dividing cells, so growth in Jar B stops while untouched roots in Jar A continue to elongate. The tissue is concentrated at the tip rather than spread along the whole root, so the other options misrepresent where growth actually occurs.",

    "question": "A forester counts the ring-like patterns on the cut trunk of a tree to estimate its age. Which meristematic tissue produced these rings, and what does it indicate about growth?",
    "options": [
      "Apical meristem; it indicates growth in length",
      "Intercalary meristem; it indicates regrowth after grazing",
      "Lateral meristem; it indicates growth in girth over successive years",
      "Ground tissue; it indicates food storage patterns"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Annual growth rings are produced by the lateral meristem, which forms a ring around the stem and adds new cells inside and outside, increasing the stem's diameter each year. Apical meristem governs length rather than girth, intercalary meristem is linked to regrowth after cutting rather than ring formation, and ground tissue is not a meristematic tissue at all.",

    "question": "After a lawn is mowed, the grass regrows and becomes bushy within a short time. Which tissue is mainly responsible for this regrowth?",
    "options": [
      "Apical meristem at the shoot tip",
      "Lateral meristem in the stem",
      "Intercalary meristem near the base of internodes",
      "Sclerenchyma in the leaf veins"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Grass regrows after mowing because of intercalary meristem located at the base of the internode or just above the node, which continues to divide even after the shoot tip is removed. The apical meristem at the original tip is destroyed by cutting, the lateral meristem is responsible for girth rather than regrowth, and sclerenchyma is a permanent supporting tissue incapable of division.",

  {
    "id": 14,
    "question": "On a plant stem, new branches or leaves typically arise from a specific point. What is this point called, and what is the region between two such points called?",
    "options": [
      "Node; the region between two nodes is called the internode",
      "Internode; the region between two internodes is called the node",
      "Meristem; the region between two meristems is called the cortex",
      "Apex; the region between two apices is called the girth"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The node is the point on a stem where branches or leaves arise, and the stretch of stem between two nodes is called the internode. The other options reverse these terms or introduce terms, like cortex and girth, that do not correctly describe this specific relationship.",

  {
    "id": 15,
    "question": "Meristematic cells are small, thin-walled, densely cytoplasmic and typically lack large vacuoles. Why is the absence of large vacuoles important for these cells?",
    "options": [
      "It allows the cells to store more starch than other cells",
      "It allows more space for rapid, continuous cell division without the constraint of a large fluid-filled space",
      "It prevents the cells from absorbing water at all",
      "It makes the cells resistant to mechanical injury"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A large central vacuole, typical of mature plant cells, takes up most of the cell's volume and is associated with cells that have stopped dividing; meristematic cells instead remain compact with dense cytoplasm, which supports frequent, rapid division. Storage of starch and resistance to injury are functions of other permanent tissues, and lacking large vacuoles does not mean the cells cannot absorb any water at all.",
    "userAnswer": null
  },
  {
    "id": 16,
    "question": "Some newly formed cells produced by a meristem lose the ability to divide and change in structure to perform specific roles like transport or storage. What is this process called?",
    "options": [
      "Totipotency",
      "Differentiation",
      "Dedifferentiation",
      "Regeneration"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Differentiation is the process by which meristematic cells become structurally and functionally specialised, giving rise to permanent tissues. Totipotency refers to a cell's ability to develop into a whole organism, dedifferentiation is the reverse process where specialised cells regain the ability to divide, and regeneration refers to regrowth of a lost part, not the cellular specialisation process itself.",

    "question": "Xylem is described as a complex permanent tissue, while sclerenchyma is described as a simple permanent tissue. What is the key structural difference between them?",
    "options": [
      "Complex tissue is made of only one cell type, while simple tissue has several cell types",
      "Complex tissue is made of more than one type of cell working together, while simple tissue is made of only one type of cell",
      "Complex tissue is always dead, while simple tissue is always living",
      "Complex tissue is found only in animals, while simple tissue is found only in plants"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Complex permanent tissues, such as xylem and phloem, are composed of more than one type of cell working together to perform a shared function, whereas simple permanent tissues like parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma consist of only a single cell type. Option A reverses this relationship, option C is incorrect because xylem contains both living xylem parenchyma and dead conducting elements, and option D is wrong since both categories apply within plant tissues only, not animals at all.",

  {
    "id": 18,
    "question": "An aquatic plant has specialised parenchyma cells with large air spaces between them. What function does this modification most likely serve?",
    "options": [
      "It increases the plant's rigidity so it can stand upright on land",
      "It helps the plant float and exchange gases while submerged",
      "It allows the plant to conduct water more efficiently than xylem",
      "It thickens the cell walls with lignin for extra strength"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In aquatic plants, parenchyma with large intercellular air spaces forms buoyant tissue that helps the plant float and also aids in gas exchange since the surrounding water limits direct access to air. This modification does not add rigidity for standing upright, replace xylem's conducting role, or involve lignin deposition, which is instead a feature of sclerenchyma.",

    "question": "A climbing plant's tendrils can bend around a support without breaking, while a mature woody branch cannot bend in the same way. Which tissue property best explains the tendril's flexibility?",
    "options": [
      "Tendrils are made of dead sclerenchyma cells with lignified walls",
      "Tendrils contain collenchyma, whose living cells have unevenly thickened, pectin-rich corners that allow bending",
      "Tendrils lack any supporting tissue, so they simply flop freely",
      "Tendrils are made of xylem vessels, which are naturally elastic"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Collenchyma cells are living, with corners thickened by flexible pectin rather than rigid lignin, which allows structures like tendrils and young stems to bend without snapping. Sclerenchyma's lignified, dead cell walls make tissues hard and comparatively brittle rather than flexible, and tendrils are not devoid of supporting tissue nor built from xylem vessels.",

  {
    "id": 20,
    "question": "Coconut husk and walnut shell are hard and tough. Which tissue gives them this property, and why?",
    "options": [
      "Parenchyma, because its cells store starch which hardens over time",
      "Collenchyma, because pectin deposition makes the walls rigid",
      "Sclerenchyma, because lignin deposition thickens the cell walls and most cells are dead",
      "Epidermis, because the waxy cuticle makes the surface hard"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sclerenchyma cells have thick, lignified walls and are mostly dead at maturity, which makes tissues like coconut husk and walnut shell hard, strong and woody. Parenchyma cells are thin-walled and living, collenchyma provides flexibility rather than rigidity through pectin, and the epidermis is a thin protective layer that would not by itself account for such toughness.",

    "question": "Xylem is described as a complex tissue containing tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma and xylem fibres. Which of these components remains living at maturity?",
    "options": [
      "Tracheids",
      "Vessels",
      "Xylem parenchyma",
      "Xylem fibres"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Xylem parenchyma is the only living component of xylem, while tracheids, vessels and xylem fibres are primarily sclerenchymatous, meaning their walls are thickened and the cells are dead at maturity, which suits their role in water conduction and mechanical support. This distinction explains why xylem can transport water through essentially dead conduits while still containing some living cells for other functions.",

  {
    "id": 22,
    "question": "Sieve tube cells in phloem lack a nucleus at maturity yet remain functionally active in transporting food. How is this possible?",
    "options": [
      "Sieve tubes function completely independently and need no regulation",
      "Companion cells, which lie alongside sieve tubes, regulate their cellular functions",
      "Xylem vessels take over control of sieve tube activity",
      "Phloem fibres regulate the loading and unloading of sugars"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Sieve tube cells depend on adjacent companion cells, which are specialised living parenchyma cells that regulate the sieve tubes' cellular functions and monitor the loading and unloading of sugars. Xylem vessels are unrelated to phloem regulation, phloem fibres provide mechanical support rather than regulatory control, and sieve tubes cannot function entirely independently given their loss of a nucleus.",

    "id": 23,
    "question": "Compare a desert plant with a thick cuticle to a submerged aquatic plant with almost no cuticle. Why does this difference make sense functionally?",
    "options": [
      "A thick cuticle reduces water loss in dry conditions, while an aquatic plant surrounded by water has little need to prevent water loss",
      "A thick cuticle helps desert plants absorb more water directly through their leaves",
      "Aquatic plants need a thick cuticle to prevent them from absorbing too much water",
      "Cuticle thickness has no relation to water availability in the environment"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A thick waxy cuticle limits water loss through transpiration, which is highly advantageous in a dry desert environment but unnecessary, and potentially disadvantageous for gas exchange, in an aquatic plant that is already surrounded by water. The cuticle does not function to absorb water through leaves, and its thickness is very much related to the plant's water environment, not unrelated to it.",

  {
    "id": 24,
    "question": "Water absorbed by roots must travel upward against gravity through xylem, which is largely made of dead cells, to reach living cells at the top of a tall tree. Which explanation best accounts for this movement?",
    "options": [
      "Dead xylem cells actively pump water upward using energy from respiration",
      "Living cells in the leaves lose water through stomata during transpiration, creating a pull that draws water up through the continuous dead xylem conduits",
      "Water rises only due to gravity acting in reverse inside narrow tubes",
      "Root pressure alone accounts for water reaching the top of very tall trees"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Transpiration from living leaf cells through stomata creates a pulling force, called transpiration pull, that draws water upward through the continuous dead, tubular xylem cells, linking living and non-living tissue in a single functional pathway. Dead cells cannot actively pump water since they lack the necessary cellular machinery, gravity would oppose rather than assist upward movement, and root pressure alone is generally insufficient to explain water transport in very tall trees.",

    "question": "Plant tissues are organised into three tissue systems. Which system is made up of xylem and phloem together?",
    "options": [
      "Dermal tissue system",
      "Ground tissue system",
      "Vascular tissue system",
      "Meristematic tissue system"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The vascular tissue system consists of the conducting tissues, xylem and phloem, which transport water, minerals and food throughout the plant. The dermal system forms the outer covering, the ground tissue system forms the plant's main body including parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma, and \"meristematic tissue system\" is not one of the three tissue systems described in the chapter.",

    "question": "The lining of blood vessels and lungs consists of a single layer of thin, flat epithelial cells, while the skin consists of many layers of tightly packed flat cells. What does this structural difference reflect?",
    "options": [
      "Both tissues perform the exact same function, so the difference is coincidental",
      "The single thin layer supports rapid diffusion of gases and liquids, while the multilayered structure provides better protection against injury and microbes",
      "The multilayered skin allows faster diffusion than the single-layered lining of blood vessels",
      "Thickness of epithelial tissue has no relationship with its function"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A single layer of thin, flat cells minimises the distance substances must travel, supporting rapid exchange in blood vessels and lungs, while multiple layers of tightly packed cells in the skin provide a tougher barrier against mechanical injury and microbial entry. The two tissue types are structurally adapted for different, not identical, functions, and a thicker multilayered structure would actually slow diffusion rather than speed it up.",

    "options": [
      "Blood has no matrix at all, while bone has a matrix",
      "The matrix of blood is watery and jelly-like, while the matrix of bone is hard, solid and rigid",
      "Blood cells are dead, while bone cells are alive, which explains the texture difference",
      "Bone contains no cells, only matrix, while blood contains only cells"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Both tissues have a matrix, but its composition and consistency differ: blood's matrix, plasma, is watery and soft, while bone's matrix is hardened by calcium and phosphorus compounds, making it solid and rigid. Both tissues contain living cellular components, and describing bone as having \"no cells\" or blood as having \"no matrix\" misrepresents the structure of these connective tissues.",

      "Cartilage connects muscle to bone; tendon connects bone to bone",
      "Tendon and ligament both connect muscle to muscle"
    ],
    "answer": "B",

      "Smooth muscle is branched and striated, while skeletal muscle is spindle-shaped and unstriated"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Skeletal muscle fibres are unbranched, multinucleate and clearly striated, enabling strong voluntary movement; smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped with a single nucleus and no striations, suited to slow involuntary movements like digestion; and cardiac muscle fibres are branched, have a single nucleus, and show faint striations, allowing continuous rhythmic contraction.

    "question": "A gardener trims the top of a young hedge plant. Over the following weeks, the plant stops growing taller at that point but produces several new side branches lower down. What best explains this outcome?",
    "options": [
      "The lateral meristem replaces the lost apical meristem to grow new shoots in length",
      "Removing the apical meristem eliminates apical dominance, allowing intercalary or lateral buds near lower nodes to become active and branch out",
      "Cutting the stem destroys all meristematic tissue in the plant permanently",
      "The plant regenerates a completely new apical meristem at the cut surface within hours"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Once the apical meristem at the shoot tip is removed, the tissue's dominant control over vertical growth is lost, and meristematic regions at lower nodes become active, producing new branches rather than continued vertical elongation from that same tip. Lateral meristem is chiefly responsible for girth rather than replacing apical growth, cutting does not eliminate all meristematic tissue in the plant, and a functional new apical meristem does not simply regenerate at the cut surface instantly.",

      "Xylem is always located on the outside of a stem, closest to the epidermis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The layered arrangement, with epidermis outermost for protection, ground tissue providing support and storage, and vascular tissue arranged toward the centre for conduction and strength, reflects a functional organisation rather than a random distribution.

    "explanation": "Root hairs are hair-like epidermal projections that greatly increase the surface area in contact with soil, improving the efficiency of water and mineral absorption. Roots are not typically photosynthetic since they usually lack chlorophyll and light exposure, root hairs are not primarily about lignin-based strength, and food transport toward the shoot is not their main role, since food generally moves the other way, from shoot to root.",

    "options": [
      "It would lose water even faster than before",
      "It would restrict gas exchange with the surrounding water, since a thick cuticle is adapted to minimise water loss rather than aid gas exchange",
      "It would prevent photosynthesis entirely since chlorophyll cannot function under any cuticle",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A thick cuticle is an adaptation to reduce water loss in dry environments, but for a submerged plant that has no shortage of water, it would instead hinder the exchange of dissolved gases with the surrounding water, working against the plant's needs. It would not increase water loss, since that is precisely what a cuticle is built to reduce, nor would it stop photosynthesis outright, since cuticle thickness affects gas exchange rather than blocking chlorophyll's function completely.",

      "The plant would grow faster since it would lose no water at all"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Since stomata are the main pores for gas exchange and also the primary sites of transpiration, their complete absence would hinder both the uptake of gases needed for photosynthesis and respiration, and the water loss that generates the transpiration pull driving water movement through xylem. Photosynthesis is not the only process affected, root growth is not directly governed by stomata, and reduced water loss would not straightforwardly translate into faster growth given the loss of gas exchange as well.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Since phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant including the roots, severe damage to the phloem and lateral meristem around the trunk can cut off this supply, starving the roots over time even though xylem, and therefore water transport, may remain largely intact. Growth in height, governed by the separate apical meristem, is not directly accelerated by this damage, and roots are not typically capable of photosynthesis since they lack the necessary green pigment and light exposure.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The sapling's flexibility comes from collenchyma, whose living cells with pectin-thickened corners allow bending without breaking; replacing this with sclerenchyma, which has rigid, lignified walls in mostly dead cells, would make the stem harder but more brittle, increasing the risk of snapping rather than bending under wind stress.

    "explanation": "Bending at the knee and ankle hinge joints during a normal jump allows the cartilage cushioning the joint, along with surrounding muscles, to gradually absorb and dissipate the impact force, reducing sudden stress on the bones, whereas a stiff-legged landing transmits force more abruptly through the skeleton. Stiffening the joints does not enhance cartilage's cushioning role, and cartilage's shock-absorbing function remains relevant regardless of landing style, contrary to the claim that bending removes the need for it.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Since plant cells are enclosed by a rigid cell wall and plants are typically fixed in place, growth cannot occur through cell migration or widespread shape change as it can, to some extent, in animals; instead, plants rely on localised meristematic zones at root and shoot tips, along the stem's circumference, and at nodes to add new cells for length, girth and regeneration.

This localised damage would not immediately halt xylem transport throughout the whole plant, nor would it directly and permanently stop phloem transport, and the ground tissue system is not the tissue primarily responsible for this outer protective role.",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Parenchyma is described as mainly storing food but also performing photosynthesis in the green parts of the plant, and this is consistent with parenchyma being thin-walled, living cells that, when located in green tissue exposed to light, can contain chloroplasts and thus carry out photosynthesis.

      "Both A and R are true, and R correctly explains A",
      "Both A and R are true, but R does not correctly explain A",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The assertion is inaccurate because intercalary meristem, while especially noted for helping grasses regenerate after grazing or mowing, is also present at the nodes of other plants, such as hedges that become bushier after being cut. Nodes and internodes are a general feature of many plant stems, not something unique to grasses, so the reason offered is also false, making this the correct evaluation rather than any option that treats either statement as true.",

    "options": [
      "There is no real difference, since both processes involve dividing plant cells",
      "Normal meristematic division is a tightly regulated process that produces organised growth and orderly differentiation into tissues, whereas crown gall division is triggered by foreign genetic material and results in unregulated, tumour-like swelling rather than organised structures",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "While both processes involve actively dividing plant cells, meristematic division in normal growth is tightly regulated and leads to organised, functional structures through differentiation, whereas division in crown gall disease is driven by foreign bacterial genetic material and produces disorganised, tumour-like swellings rather than orderly growth. Crown gall disease specifically affects plant cells, not animal cells, and meristematic tissue is in fact defined by its strong capacity for division, unlike the claim that it cannot divide at all.",

What does this difference in arrangement most likely reflect?",
    "options": [
      "Xylem and phloem are entirely different tissues in roots compared to stems",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The differing arrangement of vascular tissue between dicot roots and stems, a central xylem core in roots versus peripheral vascular bundles in stems, reflects each organ's distinct mechanical and physiological demands, such as a root's need to resist pulling and anchor the plant, compared to a stem's need to resist bending while supporting upward growth.

    "options": [
      "The muscle would continue to contract normally on command, since muscle tissue can function entirely independently of nerves",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Since the chapter explains that muscles, whether voluntary or involuntary, cannot function independently and rely on instructions from nervous tissue, severing the nerve supply to a skeletal muscle would prevent it from receiving the signals required for voluntary contraction, leading to loss of controlled movement. Muscle tissue does not operate entirely independently of nervous input for voluntary movement, muscle tissue does not spontaneously convert into a different muscle type, and bone tissue is not directly dissolved by loss of nerve supply to an adjacent muscle.",

      "Bone marrow stem cells are totipotent in exactly the same way as the carrot phloem cells, capable of regenerating an entire new organism",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "While both examples involve cells that can divide and regenerate tissue, bone marrow stem cells are described as dividing to make new blood cells, a comparatively limited regenerative role, whereas Steward's carrot phloem cells demonstrated true totipotency by regenerating an entirely new, complete plant from a single cell.

      "Xylem fibres cannot serve both roles simultaneously, so the description must be inconsistent",

    "explanation": "Xylem fibres, though grouped within the same complex conducting tissue as tracheids and vessels, are primarily sclerenchymatous, dead, thick-walled cells whose main contribution is mechanical strength and rigidity to the plant body, rather than being the principal pathway for water movement, which is a hydraulic support role rather than a contradiction.

Which explanation best fits this combined observation?",
    "options": [
      "An abnormally thin cuticle would likely allow excessive water loss through transpiration, outpacing water uptake and causing wilting, even though the vascular and meristematic tissues themselves are functioning correctly",
      "The wilting must be caused entirely by a malfunctioning lateral meristem, unrelated to the cuticle",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Since the cuticle normally limits water loss through the epidermis, an unusually thin cuticle would be expected to allow excessive transpiration, potentially causing water loss to outpace uptake through an otherwise normally functioning vascular system, resulting in wilting even when soil moisture is adequate. The lateral meristem, which governs girth, is not directly implicated by this scenario, cuticle thickness clearly does affect a plant's water balance regardless of vascular tissue function, and cuticle thickness is a property of the epidermis rather than something directly regulated by the apical meristem.",
